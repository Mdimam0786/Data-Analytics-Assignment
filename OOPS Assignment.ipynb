    "Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines what an object will look like and      what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> An object is an instance of a class. If the class is a blueprint for a car, then an object is an actual car      built using that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Example: If you have a class Car, you can create different objects like my_car or your_car, each based on the    same blueprint (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Encapsulation means keeping the internal details (like data) of an object hidden and only allowing              interaction through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> This helps protect the object’s data and ensures that it can only be changed in controlled ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Example: If you have a Car object, you wouldn’t let anyone directly change the engine’s settings. Instead,      you provide methods like start_engine() or accelerate().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent          class). This helps avoid rewriting code and makes it easier to create new, related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Example: If you have a Vehicle class, you can create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle, reusing the        features of the Vehicle class like move() or stop().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even though they behave            differently depending on their actual class.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> This makes it easy to use a single method in different ways, depending on the object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Example: If you have a Vehicle class with a method drive(), both a Car and a Bike can have their own versions    of drive(), but you can still call drive() on both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Abstraction means focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It lets you work with          complex systems by simplifying them and hiding their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Example: When you drive a car, you just use the steering wheel and pedals without worrying about the complex    mechanics happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts help make programs easier to manage, modify, and scale by organizing them into clear, reusable, and understandable pieces."

    "Q4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not support traditional method overloading in the same way some other languages like Java or C++ do. In those languages, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python, however, supports a different approach due to its dynamic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's Approach to Method Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Default Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> You can achieve a form of method overloading using default arguments. By providing default values for            parameters, you can create methods that handle different numbers or types of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable-Length Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Python allows the use of *args (for positional arguments) and **kwargs (for keyword arguments) to handle        variable numbers of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Single Method with Conditional Logic:\n",

    "How Python’s MRO Solves the Diamond Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predictable Order: Python's MRO ensures that methods are resolved in a predictable order. In the example, B      appears before C in the MRO of D, so B's method is called first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoids Ambiguity: The MRO ensures that the base class (A) is not called multiple times. This avoids ambiguity    and makes sure each class in the hierarchy is called in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. MRO Algorithm: Python's C3 linearization ensures that all parent classes are considered and called only once,    following a specific order based on inheritance. This prevents circular or repeated calls to the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The diamond problem in multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same base class, leading to ambiguity in method resolution. Python resolves this problem using the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which ensures a predictable and consistent order for resolving methods and avoids repeated calls to the base class. We can check the MRO of any class using mro() or __mro__.\n",
